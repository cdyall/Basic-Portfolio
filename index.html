					<p>
						After 12 years of working for an engineering firm, I decided that i need to find a career that
						made me happy. I have experience within the IT industry and had great success. This lead me to
						learn a completely new yet still related skill. I decided to make a quick and drastic change by
						going back to
						school. </p>

					<p>
						In choosing to return to school I had to think about more than myself. I needed to make sure
						that I could learn and work simultaneously. I was very happy to find the Rutgers Coding Boot
						Camp. </p>
